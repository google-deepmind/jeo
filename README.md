# Jeo - Jax Geo lib

*Model training and inference for geospatial remote sensing and Earth
Observation in JAX.*

The model training is based on [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) and
[Flax](https://github.com/google/flax) libraries, while the data pipelines
utilize [tf.data](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data). The recommended
datasets are based on [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets)
for scalable and reproducible input pipelines, while other dataset loaders can
be supported as well. The code base supports running on CPUs, GPUs, or
[Google Cloud TPU VMs](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-cloud-tpu-vms).

The purposes of open-sourcing this codebase include publishing the code of
research projects developed in it and to enable easier collaborations in the
geospatial and sustainability space on model development.

# Getting started
## Installation

The first step is to checkout JEO and install relevant python dependencies in a
virtual environment:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/google-deepmind/jeo
# Go into the code directory for the examples below.
cd jeo/jeo
# Install and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# Install JEO.
pip install -e ..
```

## Local demo run

Launching a quick local model training for just a few steps on the CPU:

```sh
python -m jeo.train --config configs/tests/tiny_bit.py:runlocal \
--workdir /tmp/jeo/demo_tiny_bit
```

This will start to train a `bit` model (which is a modified convolutional
neureal net (CNN) model based on ResNet, see `jeo/models/bit.py`) on
[CIFAR-10](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cifar10) TFDS dataset.
Since we run this on a local CPU just as a demo, we appended the `:runlocal`
config arg above, which specifies within the config to run just for a few
training and evaluation steps. For more configuration details, see the config file
`jeo/configs/tests/tiny_bit.py`.

In a standard workflow, the given `workdir` will be used to save checkpoints
and potentially other artifacts, such as final evaluation metrics.
